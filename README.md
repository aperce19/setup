Welcome to Aperce19's setup page. In this page you will find all the .files and configuration settings that Aperce19 uses on his devices. 

A large portion of these files have been taken or inspired by other people's projects (cited below), I do not claim to own any of these files, and would like to thank those who generously put their files online.

Remember these settings are individual, thus you may have to modify different files to make them work with your system. At the beggining of each file I specified which lines should be modified to make these files work for you.
